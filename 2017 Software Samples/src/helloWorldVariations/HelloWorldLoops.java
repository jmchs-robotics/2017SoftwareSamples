public class HelloWorldLoops { //and Booleans
	//loops are ways of doing something over and over again. As a general rule, loops run while the criteria
	//is true, and end once the criteria is false. Where the criteria is tested changes depending on the type
	//of loop, and can even vary from loop to loop.
	//The types of loops are while, do...while, for, and for each
	//Typically, the variables used as loop counters are i, j, and k in that order (i for index).
	//while and for loops test the criteria at the beginning, and do..while loops test the criteria at the end.
	//for each loops are a bit special - they perform the code between the curly braces once for each element in
	//an array.
	//Boolean operators are used to tell an array when to stop as well as being used in if statements!
	//They are > (Greater than), < (Less than), == (Absolutely equal to - don't compare doubles with this one),
	// ! (Not - inverts true to false and vice versa), != (Not equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (Less than or equal
	// to). All boolean operators are read left to right, e.g. x < y is testing if x is less than y.
	//All boolean operators return (are computed to be) either True or False, even if they start with numbers.

		 * }else{
		 * do this
		 * }
		 */

		 *  case 2:
		 *   do this

		//a million if else keywords with their own boolean expressions. However, case break only computes absolute equality.

		for(String s : happyFace) {
			System.out.println(s); //this prints out the face easily, instead of four unique printlns, each with a line of the face.

			System.out.println(myFace[i]); //here is how you reference a specific in an array.
		}
		
		//Note that system.out.println(type[] array) will print the resource location in the Java VM.
		//This means that passing arrays passes the memory location, and to print an array you need
		//a loop.
