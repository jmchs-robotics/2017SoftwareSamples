This java project is intended as a sample and as a guide to introduce Java to people with little or no software experience.
It is not exhaustive and is intended to supplement or guide a series of lessons given by an experienced programmer. The
intended sequence was:

1. SimpleHelloWorld.java
2. HelloWorldVariables.java
3. HelloWorldLoops.java
4. HelloWorldMethods.java

Comments about syntax were deliberately left from the code base because this is not intended to stand alone as a comprehensive
lesson (also because Eclipse already does a lot in the way of avoiding syntax errors).

Each class contains significant commenting designed to guide the reader through different elements of a program. Remember,
software is hard to learn. Come to it with an open mind, and you will succeed!
